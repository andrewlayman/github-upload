    Description: 
        Load a Time Line schedule.        

    MODIFICATION HISTORY:

    22-Jul-91 PFG   Added "DisplayErrors" parameter to ALoadingProc
                    so that importer can do the error reporting itself 
                    when needed.

  (* Try to Erase Schedule -

                If the current schedule needs erasing, this procedure trys
                to do so.  It does this by:

                        1) seeing if there is a current schedule
                        2) getting permission from the user to erase
                        3) eraseing.

    (* LoadAFile -- Displays the instructions line at the message area
                    of the screen and offers a picklist box of files
                    whose names match the template FileName.  If a
                    file is selected, the LoadingProc will be called
                    to actually load the file.  If MustErase is set,
                    old tasks will be erased prior to calling LoadingProc.

                    Qualifies can be used to restrict the files displayed
                    to a subset of those that would be referenced by
                    the filename template.

                    Return value of TRUE indicates success. *)
