(*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EMSGetStatus --

    Determine the status of the EMS subsystem.

    Preconditions:
        None.

    Postconditions:
        The status code from EMS is returned.  Zero indicates EMS is 
        functioning correctly, anything else means not to use EMS.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE EMSGetStatus(): CARDINAL;



(*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EMSGetPageFrame --

    Find and return the page frame address, i.e. the address of physical page
    zero.

    Preconditions:
        The EMS status must have checked out ok.

    Postconditions:
        The address of the page frame is returned.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE EMSGetPageFrame(): ADDRESS;



(*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EMSGetFrameAddresses --

    Find and return the page addresses for all pages.  These might not
    be contiguous.

    Preconditions:
        The EMS status must have checked out ok.

    Postconditions:
        The address of each page in the page frame is filled into the 
        array, up to the HIGH(Pages) or the maximum number of pages,
        whichever comes first.   The number of pages is returned.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE EMSGetFrameAddresses(VAR Pages : ARRAY OF ADDRESS) : CARDINAL;




(*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EMSGetUnallocatedPages --

    Return the number of unallocated pages in EMS.

    Preconditions:
        The EMS status must have checked out ok.

    Postconditions:
        The number of pages in EMS which are currently unallocated will be
        returned.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE EMSGetUnallocatedPages(): CARDINAL;



(*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EMSAllocatePages --

    Allocate the requested number of pages, and return the handle by which
    those pages are to be known.

    Preconditions:
        The EMS status must have checked out ok.

    Postconditions:
        If TRUE is returned, the pages will have been allocated to the 
        returned handle and be available for mapping.  Otherwise, FALSE will
        be returned.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE EMSAllocatePages(    PagesWanted  : CARDINAL;
                           VAR EMSHandle    : CARDINAL)
                                                       : BOOLEAN;




(*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EMSPageMap --

    Map and unmap logical pages of an EMS handle into physical pages of the
    page frame.

    Preconditions:
        The EMS status must have checked out ok.
        The handle given must have been created by EMSAllocatePages, the 
        physical page number must be in the range (0..3), and the logical
        page number must be within the range (0..PagesWanted - 1).  To unmap
        a physical page, specify a logical page number of 0FFFFH.

    Postconditions:
        If the logical page is successfully mapped into the physical page,
        (or unmapped, if that was requested) then TRUE will be returned.
        FALSE will be returned if there was an error.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE EMSPageMap(    EMSHandle          : CARDINAL;
                         LogicalPage        : CARDINAL;
                         PhysicalPage       : CARDINAL)
                                                       : BOOLEAN;



(*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EMSDeallocatePages --

    Dispose of the given handle and the logical pages associated with it.

    Preconditions:
        The EMS status must have checked out ok.
        The handle given must have been created by EMSAllocatePages.

    Postconditions:
        The EMS handle and pages will be returned to the pool of available
        EMS resources.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE EMSDeallocatePages(VAR EMSHandle  : CARDINAL);



(*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EMSGetVersion --

    Return the version of EMS software installed.

    Preconditions:
        The EMS status must have checked out ok.

    Postconditions:
        The version number will be returned as a CARDINAL number, with major
        and minor version numbers.  A returned value of 40 indicated version
        4.0.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE EMSGetVersion(): CARDINAL;



(*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EMSSavePageMap --

    Saves the page mapping registers into an internal save area.

    Preconditions:
        The EMS status must have checked out ok.
        The EMS Handle must be the one returned from EMSAllocatePages.

    Postconditions:
        The EMS state is stored into a internal area and TRUE is returned,
        else FALSE is returned.
         
----------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE EMSSavePageMap(EMSHandle  : CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN;


(*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EMSRestorePageMap --

    Restores the page mapping registers from an internal save area.

    Preconditions:
        The EMS status must have checked out ok.
        The EMS Handle must be the one returned from EMSAllocatePages.
        EMSSavePageMap must have been called, and returned successfully.

    Postconditions:
        The EMS state is restored to the state it was when the 
        EMSSavePageMap procedure was called.
         
----------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE EMSRestorePageMap(EMSHandle  : CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN;
