    (*  MODIFICATION HISTORY
        16-Mar-89 LAA   Created from the old ColumnNames module, to support
                        the new Assignments Report.
        10-Jun-91 PFG   Added GetAssgColumnName to get the latest assignment
                        column name and format it for use in a data column
                        field of a form.
