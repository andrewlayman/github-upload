    Description:

        Tracing functions.  Root version, stolen by TLTrace.

        TO Turn on the tracing, use ADDIN IS TLTRACE.


    MODIFICATION HISTORY:

    RSC 29-Mar-91   First version.
    LAA 28-Aug-91   This had become somewhat obsolete, with further
                    improvements to TLTrace.  I've made the TraceLString
                    a procedure which depends on ThingsWeForgot (which is
                    subclassed by TLTrace), and I added TraceOn.
                    The default is On.  TraceIsOn is now a procedure which
                    returns the current status.

    (* Trace T String  - Given a null-terminated string, write it out
                         to the trace log if tracing is on.

        Preconditions  - none.
        Postconditions - the message has been written to the trace log
                         file if tracing is on.
    *)
PROCEDURE TraceTString( s   : ARRAY OF CHAR );




    (* Trace T And LString - Given a TString and an LString,
               print the TString followed
               by the LString to the trace log if tracing is on.

        Preconditions  - none.
        Postconditions - the message has been written to the trace log
                         file if tracing is on.
    *)
PROCEDURE TraceTAndLString(     TString    : ARRAY OF CHAR;

    (* Trace L String  - Given an LString, write it out
                         to the trace log if tracing is on.

        Preconditions  - none.
        Postconditions - the message has been written to the trace log
                         file if tracing is on.

    (* Is tracing on?  This is TRUE if there is a good chance that a
       call to TraceTString or TraceLString will do anything.

    *)

    (*  If On is TRUE, make sure tracing is turned on.  If it's FALSE,
        the turn tracing off (which inhibits any action by TraceLString,
        TraceTString, etc.).
