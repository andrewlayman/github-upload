DEFINITION MODULE KeywdSub;

    (* Substitutes the text in a string according to keywords within it.

       Keywords are in the format 
          Keyword       = "*" <Key>{ <Justification> {" "}  } "*"
          Justification = "(" { ("R" | "L" | "W") [<Number>] ")"

       such as "*DATE*" or "*TODAY (L)     *" or "*PAGE(RW4)*" .  

       Keywords are enclosed between asterisks.  Within each, there is
       a control word (which may optionally be in parenthesis) and,
       optionally a justification control, which is either "(L)" or "(R)"
       or "W" and which may be followed by a number, 1 to 4 digits.

       When numbers follow the letters, they have the following meanings:

       R : Tab stop from right.
       L : Tab stop from left.
       W : Field width.

       If the control word is in parenthesis, as in "(CODE(\12))" it may 
       be followed by parameters themselves within parenthesis.   

       See the REPORTS header section of the Time Line 4.0 manual for 
       full details.   See also SchedKey for a sample procedure.

       AGetKeyWordValueProc

       Purpose:  Given the text of a keyword, return a substitution value.

       Preconditions:  KeyWord is an LString.
                     
       PostConditions: KeyValue is an LString containing the corresponding
                       value indicated by KeyWord.

       Exceptions:     Failures to match any known keyword generally return
                       a null string in KeyValue.

     AGetKeyWordValueProc = PROCEDURE (
                               VAR (* KeyWord:*)   ARRAY OF CHAR,
                               VAR (* KeyValue:*)  ARRAY OF CHAR,
                                   (* Context:*)   ADDRESS 
                             );



    (* -------------------------------------------------------------------

       MakeSubstitutions

       Purpose:  Takes a string containing keywords, and returns a string
                 with the keywords replaced by their values.  Keywords
                 are either enclosed in parenthesis, or terminated by the
                 "*" or justification control.

       Preconditions: S is an LString.
                     
       PostConditions: LengthOf(S) <= MaxLength
                       LengthOF(S) <= HIGH(S)
                       The keywords formerly within S have been replaced
                       by new text.  This may have pushed some existing 
                       text past the right-hand edge of S, in which case
                       it is lost.

                       The translation of keyword to new text is accomplished
                       by calling GetKeyWordValue(KeyWord, KeyValue, Context); 
                       (KeyWord is not translated to upper-case.)

                                 GetKeyWordValue : AGetKeyWordValueProc;
                                 Context  : ADDRESS );

END KeywdSub.
