      IndProjects

      This module determines if the schedule consists of one connected network,
      or several unconnected networks (independent projects).  Each weakly 
      connected network of task nodes is identified as a project.  For each
      such network, a single node is identified as a terminal node and marked
      as such.  This may require creating an extra node and adding it as a
      temporary, zero-length task to the network.
