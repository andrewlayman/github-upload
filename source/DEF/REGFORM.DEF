    (* InitRegistryForm - Initialize the code that brings up the Login form.
                          This routine is tied closely to the Registry and
                          RegSupport modules.  This call will "steal" the
                          GetRegistryInfo procedure variable exported from
                          Registry
    *)

PROCEDURE InitRegistryForm();

END RegForm.
