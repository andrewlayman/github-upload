DEFINITION MODULE Filter1;

        (* Filter1 -- Determine filter status of a single task, resource,
                      assignment or dependency.


           This module determines which of the current filters would be
           passed by the resource.  The ATaskFilterSet returned reflects
           the result of applying each of the active filters to the 
           resource.  We only check the portions of those filters that
           specify resource information, specifically the resource names
           and keywords.

           Although we return a set that is lables ATaskFilterSet, it is
           really a set of succeeding filters.  Until now, these have been
           only used for tasks, but we remove that restriction.
