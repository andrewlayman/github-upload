    (*  MODIFICATION HISTORY
        16-Mar-89 LAA   Created from the old ColumnNames module, to support
                        the new Assignments Report.
        10-Jun-91 PFG   Added GetRsrcColumnName to get the latest resource
                        column name and format it for use in a data column
                        field of a form.

        Postconditions:
            If the use count is zero, and if heap space is available, the

            count is > 0, it will just be incremented.  Otherwise,  FALSE will

            Get rid of the column name tree made by CreateRsrcColumnsTree.

        Preconditions:
            The column name tree must have been created by a call to
            CreateRsrcColumnsTree.

        Postconditions:
            If the use count is 1, the column name tree and all it's node 
            will be discarded.  Otherwise, the use count will be decremented.

        Postconditions:
            If the user selects a new column name, the ColumnId and 
            ColumnName will be changed to that for the new column, and TRUE 
            will be returned.  If no column name is selected, FALSE will be 
            returned.
