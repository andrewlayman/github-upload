    (* InitRegistrySupport - Initialize the code that does the bulk of the
                             work specified in the registry module.  This 
                             routine is tied closely to the Registry module.
                             This call will "steal" the GetRegistryInfo
                             procedure variable exported from Registry
    *)

PROCEDURE InitRegistrySupport();

END RegSupport.
