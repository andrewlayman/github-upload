DEFINITION MODULE MakeForm;

    (* MakeForm -- Construct a basic dialog form independent of its
                   internal representation based on (primarily) coded
                   ascii text.


    RULES OF USE:

           IF YOU CREATE THE FORM HERE:

              - You cannot create a second form before filling the
                first one in.  The first form must have at least one field
                filled in before creating the second form!!

           IF THE FORM IS FROM THE FORMS FILE:

              - It must ALREADY have at least one field!!

              - Before adding any fields, you must FIRST either:

                    1) Call "StartNewGroup", or
                    
                    2) Set Fields[MaxField+1].Group := Fields[MaxField].Group;
