       list.  The two lists are not empty (not NIL).

                          to the Start Date of the next entry.

  (* In version TLWin, resource rates are floating point and were in
     wild ranges.
     For TL5 DOS, we need rates to be more rigidly defined as
     n people at m percent, where n and m are both cardinals.

     This routine taken from TLITL2.MOD, the TL2 importer.

     Cases:
         Resource record:
                Fraction < 0.01  (version 2 allowed zeroes and negatives!)
                Fraction > (9999 @ 999%)

         Assignment record:
                Fraction < 0.00  (version 2 allowed negatives!)
                Fraction > 655.35 (vers 2 allowed up to 9,999,999,999.00)
                Fraction > <Resource's maximum>

                Note that the resources maximum CAN BE > 655.35!

     This procedure tries to do a good job picking the number and percent.

     Preconditions  - Name       is the prefix for the message. (rsrc name)
                      Fraction   is the version 2 rate.
                      UpperLimit is the max possible for this rsrc/assignment.
                      LowerLimit is the min possible for this rsrc/assignment.
                      NLimit     is the desired upper bound for the number field.
                      PLimit     is the desired upper bound for the percent field.
                      Number     is the resulting n people.
                      Percent    is the resulting percentage.
