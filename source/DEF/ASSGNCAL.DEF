            ComputeEffortsAndCostsInPeriod --

            Purpose:
                To calculate the amount of effort and its associated cost
                for a particular period.

                Within the period, there are one or more "intervals", each
                with a different cost rate and/or assignment rate than those
                adjacent to it. We compute the efforts and costs in each such
                interval and sum them up over the whole period.

            Preconditions:
                A VaryingAssignment profile exists.

            Postconditions:
                Return the number of workhours and the costs, if any.
                If there are none, return FALSE.

            Inputs:
                Three things from the assignment record:
                    Handle for VaryingAssignmentList
                    Handle for assigneed Resource's VaryingRateList
                    EndOfSpending date

                Period of interest
                    (a half-open period beginning at PeriodStart and ending
                     one tic before PeriodEnd)
                WeWantSpent (as opposed to ToGo)

            Outputs:
                PeriodWorkHours
                PeriodCosts
                Did spending occur in period?

        ComputePortionOfSpendingInPeriod --

        Purpose:
            Given a Period of interest, an interval of spending activity,
            an amount of "something" (usually a quantity) return the 
            portion of this quantity which occurs in this period,
            assuming rate of spending is constant over the spending 
            interval.
            
            Return FALSE if there was no spending in the period. Else,
            return the quantity of spending quantity (e.g. "2 spent"),
            as well as the interval within this period in which spending
            occurred (so cost rates can be computed and applied to this
            quantity, if it wasn't "dollars" already).

        Preconditions:
            Caller has figured out the correct spending interval, which
            could have End < Start (meaning lump all costs at End).

        PostConditions:
            Return TRUE if there was spending in the period, else FALSE.
            Else, the amount passed in is scaled back to the proportion 
            spent in period, and we pass out the Start and End dates of
            the spending interval.

        Inputs:
            Spending Information:
                SpentAmount, SpendingStart, SpendingEnd
            Period information:
                PeriodStart, PeriodEnd
            ThisIsSpent - needed to handle special case

        Outputs:
            ScaledAmount
            IntervalStart, IntervalEnd
            Whether spending occurred or not in this period

                  PeriodStart,

    (* AssignmentDollars

        Take an assignment, a period, and hints as to whether Spent or
        ToGo or baseline amounts are desired, and return the best figure
        possible, or at least some "plausible" estimate.  If it is a Resource
        assignment, we'll try to call ComputeEffortAndCostsInPeriod if it has
        a VaryingAssignment attached, else we call AssignmentCost().  For 
        non-Resources, we call ComputeLinearCostsInPeriod.


        Interface to this proc is the same as RsrcCalc.AssignmentCost().
        That's to make it easy to replace calls to that with calls to this.
