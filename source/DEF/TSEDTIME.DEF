DEFINITION MODULE TSEDTimescale;

    (*  MODIFICATION HISTORY
        01-Jun-89 CMH   Removed obsolete variable. 
         1-Aug-89 CMH   Added variables to indicate whether or not a 
                        date range was input. 
         5-Sep-89 CMH   Moved UnitsForScaling, CharactersForScaling,
                        UnitsForGrouping and MilitaryTime to 
                        TimeUnitsTLGS.DEF from TSEDTimescale.DEF so 
                        TLNBUILD would not import from TSEDTimescale 
                        since it has 1.6k bytes of data.
         6-Sep-89 CMH   Moved GanttTimescaling and GetDurationBarDates
                        from TSEDTimescale to GanttTimescale.  Moved 
                        AddTimescaling and AddTimeScalingVert from 
                        TSEDTimescale to PertTimescale.
        30-Mar-90 RSC   Made Timeu to Timei/TimeForm conversions.
