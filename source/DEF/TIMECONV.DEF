DEFINITION MODULE TimeConversions;

(*  Provides a mechanism for converting an internal date which was stored
    using an old calendar into the current format (as defined by the Timeu
    globals).

    MODIFICATION HISTORY:


        30-Mar-90 RSC   Made Timeu to Timei/TimeForm conversions.

FROM Timei                  IMPORT
    (* TYPE *)                  ADate, ADurationUnit, ADuration;


PROCEDURE BeforeCalendarChange();

(*  Store whatever information is pertinent to the current calendar
    (presumably before changing it).
*)


PROCEDURE AfterCalendarChange();

(*  Sets up some internal data structures to aid in the
    conversion process.  This must be called AFTER the calendar has been
    changed.
*)



PROCEDURE ToNewDate    ( VAR OldDate   : ADate );

(*  Return the converted value of the given date which is compatible with
    the current calendar.

    Preconditions:      BeforeCalendarChange and AfterCalendarChange must have been
                        called (in that order).  The given date
                        must have been valid at that time.

    Postconditions:     The old date will be converted to the new calendar.
*)


PROCEDURE ToNewDuration ( VAR Dur           : ADuration;
                          VAR Scale         : ADurationUnit;
                              SaveUnits     : BOOLEAN   );

(*  Convert a duration from one calendar system to another.

    Preconditions:      BeforeCalendarChange (and AfterCalendarChange) must have been
                        called.  The given duration must have been valid
                        at that time.

    Postconditions:     The duration will be converted to the new calendar
                        (changing the scale, if necessary).
                        Iff SaveUnits is TRUE, then the external value of the
                        duration (e.g., "3 weeks") will be preserved, even if
                        the definition of the unit has changed.
*)


PROCEDURE ToNewScale    ( VAR Dur           : ADuration;
                          VAR Scale         : ADurationUnit;
                              SaveUnits     : BOOLEAN   );


(*  Convert a layout scale from one calendar system to another.

    Preconditions:      BeforeCalendarChange (and AfterCalendarChange) must have been
                        called.  The given scale must have been valid
                        at that time.

    Postconditions:     The scale will be converted to the new calendar.
                        Iff SaveUnits is TRUE, then the external value of the
                        duration (e.g., "3 weeks") will be preserved, even if
                        the definition of the unit has changed.
