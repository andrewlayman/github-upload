    (*

       RSC 21-Dec-88   Initial version from Captions.Mod.
       RSC 20-Feb-89   Added Resource, Edge, and Assignment columns.
       RSC  7-Mar-89   Added new Gantt columns for LAZLO.  We now have
                       a total of 95 columns.  Also added a new format
                       type of a "truncated string", that is, one with
                       a "+" sign at the end if truncated.
       RSC 13-Mar-89   Added 7 more gantt columns, bringing us to 102.
       RSC  3-Apr-89   Updated the cross tab "XTabLastColumn" constant,
                       which was causing an extra column of blanks
                       to show up.
       RSC 12-May-89   1) Changed "TaskIsLocked" to "TimeElapsedPct"
                       2) Added 10 coding fields.
       RSC 20-May-89   Changed "Man" columns to "Work" columns.
       RSC 30-May-89   Added 10 MORE coding fields.
       EGK 12-Jun-89   Changed XTabBaseLineOffset to 19, and adjusted
                       XTabLastColumn appropriately.
       LAA 06-Jul-89   Changed the magic number of Aux 18 column from 110 to
                       120, which is what it always should have been.
       MWP 27-Jun-89   ( App. ) Added baseline columns to assignments.
       MWP 11-Jul-89   Removed Task ID field from assignemnts and dependencies.
        1-Aug-89 RSC   Remove SequenceNumber column.  It is now an available
                       slot for a future number.
       MWP 23-Aug-89   Added WBS Errors field.
       MWP 22-Sep-89   Created the 'Sagan constant', which is equal to
                       1 billion billion and the Hawking constant, which
                       is equal to the minus of the Sagan constant.
       RSC 29-Nov-89   Added the EffortVariance column.
       AJL 20-Jul-90   Added "NumberOfCodingFields," now 50.
       TGS 22-Aug-90   Added new XTab columns.
       14-Sep-90 PFG   Added SplittingRuleColumn.  Changed CodingField1 from
                       103 to 104.  Removed old commented out CodingFields.
       17-Sep-90 PFG   Changed FixedStartColumn to UserEnteredStartColumn.  
                       Added SupposedToStartColumn, UserEnteredEndColumn, 
                       LateIndEndColumn, LateIndStartColumn.  Moved 
                       CodingFields down a few more to make room.
       02-Oct-90 TGS   Added some more XTab columns.
        9-Oct-90 AJL   Added IndSlackColumn, SeqNumColumn, AllowSlackColumn,
                       RequiredStartColumn
                       Moved the Coding fields down quite a bit to make room.
                       Added RsrcSeqNumColumn.
                       Added LastNonCodingTaskColumn.
       29-Oct-90 AJL   Moved the cross tab column numbers to XTabColNUmbers
                       module, XTabColN.def.
        3-Apr-91 TGS   Added 20 new columns.
        5-Apr-91 TGS   Well, there were too many identifiers here again.
                       Since the biggest culprit is task columns, let's move
                       them to their own brand new module, TaskColNumbers,
                       TaskColN.def.
        7-May-91 TGS   Add new Resource columns.
       20-May-91 TGS   Remove the "overtime" resource column.
