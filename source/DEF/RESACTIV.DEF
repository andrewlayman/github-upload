     (* Procedures used by resource levelling to activate tasks on the
        candidates list. 
    
        MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        
        May, 89    JES - created.
        30-Mar-90  RSC   Made Timeu to Timei/TimeForm conversions.
        Oct 1, 90  JES - exported CreateSubstitutableResourceAssignments
                          so that cpm can use it.
        Oct. 3, 90 AJL - Added two more parameters to 
                         CreateSubstitutableResourceAssignments.
        Oct  4, 90 JES - Removed one of the above parameters since it
                         had no effect.
         6-Nov-90  CL  - To CreateSubstitutableResourceAssignment, add	 
		                 a parameter Contour.
        Nov 15, 90 JES - Moved the procedure
                         CreateSubstitutableResourceAssignments
                         from this module to the ResSched module, since
                         it is now used at several other levels.
        May 21, 91 JES - Added VAR parameter "WeActivatedSomething" to
                          ActivateCandidates.                          
        May 26, 91 JES - Added VAR parameter "WeBumpedSomething" to
                          ActivateCandidates.
        Jun 18, 91 JES - Changed name of VAR parameter UnscheduledList
                          to PreCandidatesList in ActivateCandidates.

(*  Examine each task on the candidates list, either
    activating or bypassing. "Day" is a desired
    upper bound on all start dates for this iteration;
    it is controlled by the caller.

    The return parameter "WeActivatedSomething" is set to
    TRUE iff any tasks were moved to the active list by this
    procedure, with the following exception: any task that
    was moved to the active list but (a) has its DontBump
    flag set and (b) could not possibly have affected resource
    availabilities in its activation (e.g., the task was marked
    "AlreadyScheduled" by cpm), will not cause "WeActivatedSomething"
    to be set to TRUE.
