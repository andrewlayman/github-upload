    GetNextEvent --

    Return the next event which happens (or has happened).

    Preconditions:
        None.

    Postconditions:
        The next available event will be returned.  If no event is available, 
        this procedure will wait for one, and then return it.

    PushEvent --

    Force the indicated event to be the next one returned by GetNextEvent.

    Preconditions:
        None.

    Postconditions:
        The indicated event will be pushed onto an internal 1-deep stack so
        that the next call to GetNextEvent will return it.  Only one event
        may be pushed between calls to GetNextEvent, or data will be lost.
