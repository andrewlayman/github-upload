DEFINITION MODULE Keys;

    (* MODIFICATION HISTORY:

       Aug. 22, 1985, AJL - Changed special keys to range 256..511.
       Oct. 15, 1987, RSC - Latest key updates and added EditBigTaskKey and
                            NetworkKey.
       Jan.  4, 1989, RSC - Merged in relevant "Action" codes from Actions.Def
       Feb. 28, 1989, WKH - Changed constants for FileRetrieve, FileErase, and 
                            PlotGantt so that they don't conflict with codes
                            generated by ALT+(PgUP, Home, End) on the 101-key
                            keyboards.  Only happens with the keys on the 
                            special cursor keypad.
        13-Apr-89 LAA   Swapped the code numbers assigned to DependViewKey and
                        AnteKey.  This will have the effect of swapping the
                        function of F4 and Shift-F4 so that F4 will now bring
                        up the dependency list, and Shift-F4 will show
                        dependencies with filter colors.
        01-May-89 WKH   Resolve keycode conflicts with new 101-key keyboards.
                        This will be the last fix for this problem.  I 
                        painstakingly mapped each code that the new kbd.
                        generates and made sure we stayed clear of these.
        13-Jul-89 EGK   Changed "PrjtNotesKey" to "GotoWBSKey".
         9-Aug-89 RSC   Added Cut/Paste keys.
         6-Dec-89 RSC   Added mouse keys.  Lots and lots of them.
         7-Oct-90 AJL   Added AlternateEraseKey.
        15-Oct-90 RSC   Added the Sound keys.
        24-Jan-91 AJL   Redefined Alt-F8 as HistSynchKey, formerly 
                        ManualFilterKey.

    (* Note on extended 101 key keyboards.  We were having problems with some
       of the new keys on these keyboards mapping into previously "secret"
       keycodes used by Time Line to invoke functions from menus and such.
       Well, after painstaking mapping of these new codes generated by these
       new keys, it turns out that they map into the regions btwn. 257 and
       422.  While they don't interfere with any of the above code 
       definitions, they do intertwind pretty tightly.  It is my 
       recommendation that all new special codes begin above 422 for safety.
       In fact, I would just start at the next highest number in the 
       following list for even more safety.       WKH 5/1/89

        the X position as ASCII "0" + <X>, or "0" to ""(79).
