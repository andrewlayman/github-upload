   (*
      The decimal value of the extended character is 256 + decimal (aux. byte).
      The decimal value of the character is calculated.
      The decimal is ([index]+271); the character is Key[decimal-271].
      These characters begin with Reverse-Tab; aux. byte = 15; (256 + 15 = 271).
        - For all reasonable purposes, this is first extended character.
      There are 118 - 23 = 95 of these extended keys.
      The missing two keys from Norton's list are Ctrl-PrtSc and Would-be-null.
