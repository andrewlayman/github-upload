  (* Get Message Word - Get the nth word (0...m) from a phrase.

        Preconditions  - Phrase  is the phrase to get from the phrases file.
                         WordNumber is the Nth substring to return, N starting
                                        with 0 (for ORD(Enumeration)).  Substrings
                                        are delimited by commas.
        Postconditions - LString is the phrase.

   Note: This procedure uses a one-phrase cache, so if the requested phrase
         is the same as the last requested phrase, we do not re-ask the
         message processor for it.
