            one of the CreatexxxxColumnTree procedures.

            Display the scrolling list of column names at the indicated

            and ColumnId will be changed to that for the new column, and TRUE 
            will be returned.  If no column name is selected, FALSE will be 
            returned and nothing will be changed.
