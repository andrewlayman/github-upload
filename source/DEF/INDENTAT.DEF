    FormatIndentation --

    Create a string according to the level of the node, indicate if this
    task is a summary task or not, and limit the resulting LString to the
    indicated width.  

    Preconditions:
        The given task node must not be NIL.

    Postconditions:
        An LString of the indicated width will be generated, containing blanks
        according to the indentation required, with the indicator of whether 
        this is a summary or detail task.  The length of the LString will 
        always be of the requested width, as long as the string variable is 
        big enough. Therefore, it may have to be padded with trailing blanks.
