    (*  MODIFICATION HISTORY

        21-Mar-89 RSC   Created from the old ColumnNames module, to support
                        the new Assignments Report.
         6-Nov-90 AJL  Import column numbers from XTabColNumbers.
        10-Jun-91 PFG   Added GetXTabColumnName to get the latest cross tab
                        column name and format it for use in a data column
                        field of a form.
