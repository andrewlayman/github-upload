(*  
   PushBuffer puts an empty plate on the stack.  The plate is yet to be filled.

   PopBuffer throws the top plate away.

   The stack is MacBuffer.

   MacBuffer is used during the recording of a macro.  The stack data structure
   facilitates nested macros.  The buffer is used to store the keystrokes
   during recording of the macro prior to storage in the list with ExtStorage.

Check for available room in buffer.  How to check for cases when a cardinal
code is inserted ok before a string that can't be inserted?  Must be done in
the calling procedure that inserted the code.

(*------------------------------------------------------------------------

Puts a string into a macro that is currently being recorded.  Used to
insert messages and menus that were created with the Add Menu.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE PutStrInBuffer (str  : ARRAY OF CHAR):BOOLEAN;


(*------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inserts a cardinal into a macro that is currently being recorded.  Used to
insert sentinal values before and after messages and menus.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE PutCodeInBuffer (code : CARDINAL):BOOLEAN;



  (*------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Puts a menu that was created with the menu form into the edited macro.

PROCEDURE PutMenuInBuffer():BOOLEAN;



  (*------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Puts the message that was created with the message form into the edited macro.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------*)

PROCEDURE PutMessageInBuffer():BOOLEAN;




(*------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Put the buffer's contents into a macro, ready for playback in editor.
 Used to put extended character strings, control character strings,
 messages and menus into the editted macros.

 Prerequisite : a valid buffer has been created with PushBuffer,
