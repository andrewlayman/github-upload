DEFINITION MODULE ImpTLWindows;

(*  MODIFICATION HISTORY --
    13-Mar-92 LAA   Pass the count of number of resource assignments to
                    GetAssignments, so we can put up a thermometer.
    18-Mar-92 TGS   Add parameter to GetResources for "MaxIDNumber".  This
                    is so the ResourceTable is initialized and valid over
                    the entire range of ID numbers used.  "Count" is still
                    needed to create a thermometer of proper size.
    19-Mar-92 TGS   If the Count parameter to GetResources() is MAXCARDINAL,
                    don't create a thermometer.  This is so the TLWin linker,
                    which doesn't want one, doesn't get one.
    19-Mar-92 LAA   Added a FixedCostNode parameter to GetResources.  This
                    will be returned to point to a resource implicitly created
                    so we can turn costs which are on a task in Rocky into
                    assignments to a fixed cost.
