        1/10/89     RSC     First version, from FormRead.
       13-Jun-89    RSC     Remove "FormFileShared".  It always is in LAZLO.

       22-Jan-91    RSC     Added Holder's global list header here.
                            Why here?  Welllllllll, holder is used a lot
                            by forms.  And I needed a spot to put it.
