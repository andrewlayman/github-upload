DEFINITION MODULE EdgeColumns;

    (*  MODIFICATION HISTORY
        16-Mar-89 LAA   Created from the old ColumnNames module, to support
                        the new Assignments Report.
        10-Jun-91 PFG   Added GetRsrcColumnName to get the latest resource
                        column name and format it for use in a data column
                        field of a form.
         9-Jan-92 AJL   Created this module from RsrcColumns.
