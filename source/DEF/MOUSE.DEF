TYPE
    AMouseTime      = LONGINT;      (* Eighteenths of a second *)




VAR
    (* Repeat Rate is "How long between MouseStillDown events?"
    *)
    RepeatRate      : AMouseTime;



    (* Double Click Rate is "How soon after the first click is a second
                             click deemed a double click?"
    *)
    DoubleClickRate : AMouseTime;


    (* Mouse Present answers the musical question "Is there a mouse in
                        the house?"

        Preconditions
                        None, but TLMOUSE has to have had a chance to start
                        before you can trust the response.  In other words,
                        before TLMOUSE starts up, we report FALSE even if
                        there is a mouse.


        Postconditions
                        If a mouse is present, TRUE is returned.

        Parameters
                        RETURNS TRUE if a mouse is present and TLMOUSE
                                is running, else FALSE.
    *)
    MousePresent    : PROCEDURE () : BOOLEAN;



    (*
        Cancel Double Click  - A single click has been handled AS IF it
                               were a double click action, so don't allow a
                               second click to be interpreted as a double
                               click.  This applies to menus and dialog
                               boxes, where a single click is all that is
                               needed to select the item and exit the
                               dialog/menu.

                               This is good for only the very next click.
                               It just prevents the "Is this click a double
                               click?" logic from seeing the double click.
                               If no mouse, nothing happens.

        Preconditions
                        A single click has been received and processed.
                        This is either a MouseDown, MouseStillDown, or
                        MouseUp.

        Postconditions
                        No mouse double click will be received until after
                        a single click.

        Parameters
                        None.
    *)
    CancelDoubleClick   : PROCEDURE ();


END Mouse.
