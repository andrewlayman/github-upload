    Description:

        Overlay Swpper



    MODIFICATION HISTORY:

        1-Feb-91 RSC First version.
       26-Apr-91 RSC Added new stealable vectors.  FlushOverlay, called
                     to flush the cache to free up space for an overlay
                     that wants to enter the cache.  It is stealable so
                     that TLTrace or TLDoom can steal it.
                     Also, made SwapOut and SwapIn stealable.
