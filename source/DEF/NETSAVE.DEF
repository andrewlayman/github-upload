DEFINITION MODULE NetSave;

    (*  This module manages the storage of some generic objects for the
        PERT view.  The meaning of these objects is defined elsewhere so
        that the root of Time Line doesn't need to import PERT-specific
        information.  All we know here is that we store up to DataMax
        generic flexstor objects (elements of NetSaveData) as well as one
        more object (NetSaveArray) which points to an array of other objects.

        Furthermore, we don't actually create the objects here; all we do is
        initialize our data to NILs on startup and in response to several
        kinds of notices.  The creation of this data is also done elsewhere.
