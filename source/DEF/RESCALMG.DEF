       10-Jul-90  RSC  - Cloned from ResCalUI, which got into circular
                         imports.  Changed format of
                         "MakeAvailabilityIntoResidue".
       11-Jul-90  AJL  - Documentation editting.
       24-Jul-90  RSC  - Parameter change.
       26-Oct-90  CL   - Make AddInterval an exportable procedure.
       10-Jan-91  AJL  - Add ResidueProfile as an explicit parameter
                         to MakeAvailabilityIntoResidue.
       22-Feb-91  AJL  - Add HonorDaysOff as a parameter to 
                         MakeAvailabilityIntoResidue.

    (* AddInterval - 

	If the residual availability list doesn't exist, then create one 
    with an empty head cell followed by the new interval; otherwise, 
    insert the new interval following the head cells.

    However, (1) If the length of the new interval is not positive, 
                 quit without doing anything.
    
             (2) If the interval has the same properties as the cell
                 following the head cell, the new interval is merged 
                 into that cell.
                   
             (3) The availability list used to be built in reverve 
                 chronological order when it was a singly linked list.  
                 It remains built in such order.

                 In the future, if we want to change the order of
                 building the list, we have to carefully examine
                 all the procedures which builds the list.

    Input:

        Star/Thru     the start/thru dates of the cell to be added.
        Amount        the total amount of available resource.
        Vacation      TRUE iff this is vacation time.
        ResList       NIL if the residual list does not exist.
                      Otherwise, point to the head cell of residual 
                      availability list.
        StillGoing    TRUE iff we should process this entry.

    Output:
	
        ResList       point to the head cell of updated residual list
        StillGoing    TRUE iff the operation succeeded.

(* Make Availability Into Residue

    Turn the resource's initial availability and cost rate lists into
    the initial residual availability list for RECALC.

    Preconditions -
    
            ResourcePointer must be valid (Non-NIL).
            FlexStor must be running.

    Postconditions -

            ResourcePointer^.AvailabilityList and ResourcePointer^.Calendar
            are unchanged.

            Any previously allocated ResidueProfile is
            disposed.

            The two lists, availabilities and the calendar, are merged
            into the residual availability list, ResidueProfile 
            (unless an error is returned.)



    Input

        ResourcePointer     the resource structure

        HonorDaysOff        If FALSE, the vacation calendars are ignored.
        

    Output

        ResidueProfile      Merged profile.

        RETURN              TRUE iff the residue list could be created.
                            FALSE otherwise.  If FALSE, the residue avail
                                 is NIL.

    Exceptions :            In case of error, the procedure will return
                            FALSE, the old availability list will have been
                            disposed, no new one created, and
                            ResidueAvailProfile is NIL.
