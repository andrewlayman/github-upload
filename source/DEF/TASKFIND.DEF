DEFINITION MODULE TaskFind;

(*  Provides a temporary replacement for the normal "FindTaskByNumber"
    procedure from Allocs.DEF.  Allows tasks to be located quickly
    using an array of tree node pointers, rather than the usual
    exhaustive tree search method.

       This is done here to avoid TaskFindBegin having to traverse the
       task tree.

       Do this AFTER TaskFindBegin!
