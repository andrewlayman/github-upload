DEFINITION MODULE TaskDictionary;

  (*   Routines for detemining if WBS codes exist within the current task tree.
       These routines allow us to maintain a 'Dictionary' of hashed WBS codes.
       This allows us to determine very quickly whether a task node exists which
       contains a specific WBS code, as opposed to the old method of determination
       which involved the task importer to conduct a linear search of every task
       node in the tree to see if a match occurs. The old method was OK for
       small task trees, but as the amount of nodes increased ( > 150 - 200 nodes )
       the search time for a non-match was VERY slow. This method keeps the
       time linear.
