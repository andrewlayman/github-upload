DEFINITION MODULE GanttHelper;

    (*  MODIFICATION HISTORY
        14-Dec-89 LAA   Created this module from GanttOutlines by extracting
                        the processing for the GoTo Key.  This was necessary
                        because GanttOutlines had too many symbols to compile.
        18-Dec-89 LAA   Added procedures PutVScroll and PutHScroll so Ed can
                        use them in the PERT view.

(*  DoGanttGotoKey --
        Process the Goto key from GanttOutlines, by putting up an appropriate
        GoTo list and returning the selected cursor node.
    Preconditions:

        ViewObject must be the task tree, the CursorColumn and CursorNode
        must be valid (non-zero, non-NIL).
    Postconditons:
        TRUE, and an updated cursor node will be returned iff the user pressed
        Enter or F10 from the GoTo list.
