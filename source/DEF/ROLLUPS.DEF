                        return a BOOLEAN. 
       15-Mar-88  AJL  -Removed the Planned parameter from RollupCosts.
                       -RollupCosts now rolls up both Plan and Baseline.
                       -Removed the explicit EXPORT QUALIFIED statement.
       18-Sep-89  AJL  -Removed the RollupDates procedure.
        9-Nov-89  AJL  -Removed the RollupCosts procedure.
