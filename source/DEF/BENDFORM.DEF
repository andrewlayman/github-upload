    BEnd Format - Format Resource Information

        This module is intended to do for resources what Captions does for
        tasks.  That is, given a column ID, return information about a
        resource.

        At this time, only the information about a resource COLUMN is
        returned, not information about a specific resource.


        MODIFICATION History - 

        23-Mar-89 RSC Added support for better reports.

                        > InfoChoice is the kind of information you are
                          interested in.  See Captions.Def for the choices.

                          If a string value is being returned, it may be right
                          justified, and is always exactly "Length" bytes long.

                        > If FALSE, The column does not exist.  This allows
                          looking for information on ALL columns.
