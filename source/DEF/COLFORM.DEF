    Description: 
        Calls the column name form overlay.

    MODIFICATION HISTORY:

    10-Sep-90 PFG   Created to allow column name stuff to be in an overlay.
    2-Oct-90  PFG   Added the code from the old ColumnGoToCheckProc to the 
                    TLColName overlay, and changed the context record to 
                    accomodate it.
    23-Jul-91 LAA   Changed the context of AColumnContext.  This is to fix
                    bug #4768.  You can't pass an object as context from
                    one overlay to another, unless you're sure it's in the
                    root.
