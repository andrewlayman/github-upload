DEFINITION MODULE ParseTime;

(* Parse Time:

            Parse strings representing Time.

    RSC 12/20/88  Moved here from Timeu.
    19-Sep-89  RSC  Added requirement that ParseDate and StoEndxxxx
                    take a suggested "default date".
    30-Mar-90  RSC  Made Timeu to Timei/TimeForm conversions.
    14-May-91 AJL  -Parse the keyword "FY" in a date to indicate that the
                    date contains a fiscal year.

    (*  ParseDate -- Parses the string.   Like

        PROCEDURE ParseDate (VAR s:ARRAY OF CHAR;
                             VAR Year,Month,Day,Hour,Minute:CARDINAL;

        This is declared as a VAR PROC so that it can be replaced
        by an installed overlay to supply other rules for parsing.

        19-Sep-89 RSC

        Pass down a start date for use in determining the defaults
        for end dates!!

        This always returns the date as a fiscal date, even if it was
        not so specified in the input.  So, if the start of the year is
        not January, and the date string does not explicitly indicate that
        the year is already a fiscal year, the year may be adjusted from
        what was entered.
