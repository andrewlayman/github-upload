DEFINITION MODULE TaskColNumbers;

(*  Column numbers for Task Columns.

    MODIFICATION HISTORY:

     5-Apr-91 TGS   Moved here from MagicNum, which once again got too big.
     9-Apr-91 TGS   Forgot BaselineTotalDollarsLessExtras.
     9-May-91 TGS   Rename some columns to match their functions.
    10-May-91 TGS   Anticipating that OT feature may be removed, moved all
                    related fields to the end of the Non-coding column list,
                    where they can more easily be excised (I think just by
                    changing the LastNonCodingTaskColumn constant).
                    Made it "MathematicalEAC" instead of "MathmaticalEAC".
    16-Aug-91 PFG   Moved the WBSErrors column back to a value of 123, as it
                    was in previous releases to limit the number of adjust-
                    ments we have to make as we import old layouts.

CONST

    (* This is the list of the column numbers in use by the root at the time
       that this list was put together.

       IT IS NOT, AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL COLUMNS.

       COLUMNS CAN BE ADDED AT ANY TIME BY OVERLAYS.
